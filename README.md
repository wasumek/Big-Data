## Overview

Big Data refers to datasets that are so large or complex that traditional data processing tools are inadequate to handle them. Modern big data technologies enable the efficient processing and analysis of such data, offering insights into patterns, trends, and associations. This repository features several projects using distributed computing systems like Apache Hadoop and Spark for large-scale data processing, and machine learning methods to draw insights from the data.

## Projects

1. **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and MapReduce**:
    - This project focuses on the Hadoop ecosystem, demonstrating how HDFS is used to store large datasets across distributed clusters. It also implements the MapReduce programming model to process large-scale data, performing tasks such as word count and sorting.

2. **Apache Spark for Real-Time Data Processing**:
    - Implements Apache Spark for in-memory distributed data processing, showcasing its power in handling big data analytics in real-time. Spark’s capabilities for data processing and machine learning pipelines are explored, with examples ranging from data transformation to predictive modeling.

3. **Machine Learning with Big Data**:
    - This project applies machine learning techniques, such as decision trees and k-means clustering, to large datasets. The focus is on building scalable machine learning models using Spark's MLlib library to analyze massive amounts of data and derive meaningful insights.

## Installation

To use the code, clone the repository and ensure the necessary dependencies for Hadoop, Spark, and Python are installed:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wasumek/Big-Data.git
```

## Usage

To run the projects, ensure you have access to a Hadoop or Spark cluster, or set up a local environment using tools like Apache Hadoop or Apache Spark. Follow the instructions in each project’s folder for specific setup details, running the distributed applications, and analyzing results.
